I'm currently developing this project. The general idea is to design a game similar to "El Gran DT", but with NBA players instead of Argentinian Football. Today, some validations are missing and I had to start again the part for building the team due to a problem with the data base. Before continue, I'm doing research to find some way to import the NBA statistics and use them in my web. The current data in the calendar page was hardcoded in order to prove the functions were working. It is my introduction to the MVC pattern.
